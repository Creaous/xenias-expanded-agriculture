# Xenia's Expanded Agriculture

Welcome to Xenia's Expanded Agriculture (also known as XEA)! Enjoy an expanded vanilla game with a focus on weather, seasons, farming, animals, and other aspects to make the game a little bit different.

**NOTE:** There are currently no quests in the game. This modpack is just more focused on discovering things yourself. Good luck!
