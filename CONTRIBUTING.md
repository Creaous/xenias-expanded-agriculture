# Contributing Guide

Hi there! Thank you for your interest in contributing to Xenia's Expanded Agriculture.

If you are attempting to report an issue, please do so under the [Issues](https://github.com/Creaous/xenias-expanded-agriculture/issues) tab.

## Rules

1. Please be respectful to other contributors.
2. Attempt to follow [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).
   - This is not enforced but try to stick with it if you can :)
3. Obviously do not attempt to add malware.

## Feature Restrictions

Please refrain from adding mods which:

- Add overpowered items and/or blocks which could be considered cheating.
  - e.g. [Chicken Chest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chicken-chest)
- Add easy methods to skip early game, whether that be vanilla or other mods.
  - e.g. [When Dungeons Arise](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/when-dungeons-arise)

_No hate to any mods listed here, I just do not believe they fit this modpack._

## Feature Encouragements

Please add mods that:

- Backport new vanilla features to the older version we use.
- Optimize the game in any way (e.g. with mods or just vanilla).
- Forks of existing mods that improve it in a notable way.
