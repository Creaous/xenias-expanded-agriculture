# Mods

The files here are provided by Prism Launcher (or one of it's forks). This is helpful to track the versions of mods.

## Downloading

As far as I know, there is not a way to import these files into Prism Launcher. There is a helpful script under `downloads/` which requires Python that can download these for you.

## Mod List

A copy of the mod list, generated by Prism Launcher in the Markdown format with all optional info enabled, is available [here](LIST.md).
